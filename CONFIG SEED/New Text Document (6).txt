    Structured Settlements
    Structured settlements are issued to individuals who settle a lawsuit as an alternative to large compensatory lump sums. 
	Receiving regular payments from a structured settlement can be helpful in managing your expenses, however, 
	there are times when you need your money, perhaps because of an unexpected bill or other significant expense, 
	and the payments you currently have from your structured settlement aren‚Äôt cutting it. We can purchase all or part 
	of your future structured settlement payments to provide you with a lump sum of cash to help you meet your goals.**

	debate with two sharply different messages ‚Äî about 
    leadership and, to an extent, the current state of the city.
    Cal State officially drops SAT and ACT. Trustees of the largest four-year university system in the nation agreed Wednesday to permanently 
	drop the standardized tests in its admissions 
    process, solidifying the state‚Äôs national role in eliminating the high-stakes exams because of equity concerns.
    Community colleges failed to turn over fraud data. Despite a request from the chancellor‚Äôs office last August for data on enrollment fraud 
	involving fake student bots, nearly 40% of 
    campuses failed to submit any information, deepening concerns about the extent of possible wrongdoing.
    L.A. County‚Äôs push to hand out Narcan. Deaths from drug overdoses have surged. Health officials set a goal to distribute 50,000 boxes of 
	the medicine ‚Äî which can pull someone out of an 
    opioid overdose ‚Äî by this August through free vending machines, community groups and homeless encampments.
    Viral Tesla crash leaves Echo Park residents picking up the pieces. For the internet, the black Tesla that jumped over the Baxter Street 
	hill was a viral moment to behold. Then the
	driver abandoned the rented car after it hit two vehicles. The LAPD is offering a reward for information.
    Court approves sale of L.A.‚Äôs biggest mansion. The $141-million offer by Fashion Nova founder Richard Saghian for the Bel-Air mega-mansion
	known as ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù was approved Monday. The 
    home‚Äôs developer, Nile Niami, was unsuccessful in assembling a last-minute offer.

	get the rebate too, as will any individual wealthy enough to ‚Äúneed‚Äù more than one car. The knock against sending debit cards to EV drivers is that we pay no gas
	taxes, so there‚Äôs nothing to rebate us ‚Äî though that isn‚Äôt entirely true, since we pay at least $100 extra in registration fees each year, no matter how many 
	miles we drive (as opposed to a gas burner, who can reduce his tax burden simply by driving less). But that doesn‚Äôt begin to justify giving us or anyone $400 
	simply for having a car right now.
    
    Because cars, especially gas-powered ones, are generally bad. They pollute, even the electric ones. They kill. They require massive amounts of paved-over land 
	that can be used for housing (and often did hold homes before engineers decided the freeway needed another lane, or 15). Worst of all, they turn their human 
	operators into entitled misanthropes who casually endanger pedestrians or consider voting for an increasingly fascist political party because it promises cheaper
	fuel.always accurately ‚Äî known for its liberal, live-and-let-live ethos. But Breed‚Äôs efforts have also been faulted by some Democrats who argue she is falling back

    For his part, Griffin praised Irvin as ‚Äúself-made‚Äù with a life story that ‚Äúepitomizes‚Äù the American dream. ‚ÄúI have tremendous respect for 
	all that he has accomplished,‚Äù Griffin said in his statement that also offered a glimpse about his own concerns about the state. ‚ÄúI care 
	deeply about Illinois. I came to Chicago 30 years ago to start my career and my partners and I have built an incredible firm in our state,‚Äù
	Griffin said, then blamed Pritzker, who‚Äôs been in office for three years, for ‚Äúhurting not only our firm, but also countless other Illinois 
	success stories.‚Äù
    
    
    Griffin, also the largest individual donor to GOP super PACs trying to flip control of Congress, has vowed to do whatever he can to defeat
	Pritzker. Griffin said Irvin knows ‚Äúthe importance of ending wasteful spending and reducing oppressively high taxes.‚Äù
    
    Griffin‚Äôs enormous donation sets the stage for the governor‚Äôs race to be among the most expensive ever and Irvin will be able to saturate the airwaves.
    
    The question is whether southern Illinoisans will be moved, knowing that Irvin isn‚Äôt as far right as state Sen. Darren Bailey, for example, 
	who is closely aligned with Donald Trump. Irvin has ducked and dodged questions about whether he voted for the former president.
    
    The five Republicans running for governor ‚Äî Irvin, Bailey, former state Sen. Paul Schimpf, businessman Gary Rabine, and venture capitalist 
	Jesse Sullivan ‚Äî ‚Äúhave all done their best to dance around Trump and thread the needle of alienating neither Trump supporters nor anti-Trump
	moderates and independents,‚Äù explains Tribune‚Äôs Rick Pearson.

	The crisis in Ukraine seems far away, but for many residents of Chicago‚Äôs Ukrainian Village neighborhood, it hits home,
	Sen. Dick Durbin told Playbook in an interview over the weekend.
    
    Interest in Ukraine also extends to the Chicago area‚Äôs Polish populations from Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Romania 
	‚Äî ‚Äúthey‚Äôre people who understand that Putin‚Äôs adventurism and thuggery are a direct threat to countries that their 
	families call home,‚Äù Durbin said.
    
    In a larger context, he said, ‚ÄúWorld War II was fought and won by the United States and its allies to stop this kind of
	aggression by Hitler and others, and to make it clear that in this modern world it is unacceptable conduct."
    
    Durbin said that hit home for him last week when he met the new chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz. ‚ÄúHe made this chilling statement.
	He said, ‚ÄòWe have memories of a land war in Europe. And this is a land war in Europe.‚Äô That sharp declaration spoke volumes to 
	the price you pay when you shrug your shoulders and say well ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just Ukraine.‚Äô‚Äù
    
    Durbin said the crisis in Ukraine could also slow the process to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
    
    During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing a few days ago, President Joe Biden talked about a slow-down in the process. 
	‚ÄúHe ended the meeting saying that we‚Äôre focused on a timetable for approving the [SCOTUS] nominee, and he said this conversation 
	could be interrupted by Ukraine,‚Äù said Durbin, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee. ‚ÄúHe feels that concerned about it and should.
	He‚Äôs worried about Americans who have been warned to pick up and leave and get out as fast as they can and have been slow to do that.
	He‚Äôs worried about that and so am I.‚Äù
